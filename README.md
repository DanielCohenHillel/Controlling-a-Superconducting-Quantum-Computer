# Controlling a Superconducting Quantum Computer💻
This is my project for my bachelors degree done at The Weizmann Institute.

In the "codes" folder you'll find 2 sub-directories

* **Mixer Optimization**🎛 - Used to calibrate the Quantum Machine as an AWG connected to an IQ mixer. You can learn more about it in chapter 4 of the project located at the "Writing" folder.
* **GRAPE**🍇 - The GRAPE algorithm is a quantum optimal control algorithm, used to simulate the qubit-cavity system to optimize the control pulses of the system. You can learn more about it in chapter 3 of the project located at the "Writing" folder.

If for some weird reason you found this repository and you want to ask me something you can email me at danielcohenhillel@gmail.com.
